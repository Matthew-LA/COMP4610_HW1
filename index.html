                    <p class="quote-text">"In 2010, Lisa Hopkins got the phone call every military parent dreads. Her son, Josh Sommers, was severely wounded by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) in Afghanistan. Lisa immediately left her home in Ohio and her manufacturing job to be by his bedside. “I had to drop everything, but I knew it was what I had to do,” says Lisa. “It was hard to see him. But I knew I had to be with him."</p>
