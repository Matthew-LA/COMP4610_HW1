Joshua Sommers Tribute Page
This project is a tribute to Joshua Sommers, a brave military veteran who served in the 101st 3BCT, FT. Campbell, KY. It was built with HTML and CSS and designed to provide an overview of his journey, along with the touching stories associated with him.

Project Structure
The webpage has been structured into various sections as follows:

Header Section: This part includes a title with the name "Joshua Sommers" along with a stylized representation of the Purple Heart medal.

Video Section: Here I have embedded a YouTube video related to Joshua Sommers' journey. It showcases his experience and gives viewers a closer look at his life and struggles.

Quotes and Images Section: This section is divided into multiple quote-containers each containing an image, a quote and a link to the related article. The first quote-container has the image on the left and text on the right. The second quote-container has the image on the right and text on the left. This pattern provides a visually appealing layout.

Footer Section: This contains a CSS validation badge that shows the CSS for the webpage has been validated by the W3C CSS Validation Service.

Styling
I have made use of CSS to enhance the look of the webpage, including a purple heart representation in CSS for the header, and a hover effect on the quote-container which changes the color of text and image.

Both images and quotes in the quote-container are clickable and will redirect to the original article when clicked.

The video is displayed in a large format, for easy viewing and a better user experience.

Borders have been added to the quote-containers and the video for enhanced visibility and a neat look.

Validity
The CSS for this page has been validated by the W3C CSS Validation Service. The badge for this validation can be found at the bottom of the page in the footer section.

Accessibility
Alt-text has been provided for all images to support screen readers and browsers where images cannot be rendered. This ensures the webpage is accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments.

Usage
This project is free to use and can be modified as needed. It serves as a tribute to Joshua Sommers and can be used as a template for similar tribute or personal pages.
